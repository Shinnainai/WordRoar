# WordRoar

This repository hold my Final Year Project for my Software Development Degree Program.

My FYP consists of an Android Mobile Application for Speech Therapy. 
This application is called Word Roar and is aimed at young kids, aged 6-12, who struggle with Speech Conditions.

"Speech therapy is the science that specializes in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of communication disorders."

I will be updating the repository more as I move forward with the project.

Any feedback is welcome!
